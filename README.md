# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository provides implementations and explanations of various data structures, algorithms, and related concepts in the C++ programming language. 
It covers different types of patterns, number system conversions, and fundamental algorithms like finding min and max elements.

## Introduction
Understanding data structures and algorithms is essential for every programmer. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive overview of different 
data structures, algorithms, and related concepts. The implementations are done in C++ to help you grasp the concepts and apply them in your projects.

## Patterns
The `patterns` directory contains various C++ programs to generate different types of patterns, such as pyramid patterns, number patterns, and more.
These patterns are often used for display purposes and can also aid in understanding loops and conditional statements.

## Number System Conversions
The `number_system_conversions` directory contains C++ programs to convert numbers between different number systems, including binary, octal, decimal,
and hexadecimal. Understanding number system conversions is crucial for low-level programming and dealing with computer memory.

## Algorithms
The `algorithms` directory contains implementations of fundamental algorithms, including finding the minimum and maximum elements in an array. 
These algorithms are the building blocks for solving more complex problems efficiently.
